## Add or Edit a Team
Teams are going to be rather important to the user, since you're likely not changing teams for a season, and you will be reusing them a lot. But the question becomes what data do you want to describe the team you are on.
 - Team Name
 - Position
 - Number
 - Jersey Color?

## Add or Edit a League
Most of the time, people play in leagues. This field should be optional though because you might play a pick up game, or a no commitment game in the case of StinkySocks, or you might be a sub. Leagues are also indicative of what level the game is. Like if I played PowerPlay D1 then I know that's a high D level skate, which can be compared to other D level skates.
- Name
- Level
- Link to a Website?

## Add or Edit a Season
Typically I play in the same league for multiple seasons, so I like grouping them together.
- Name?

## Add or edit a game
Right now this might be the data model I want to run with
- Position - This could be as simple as Skater/Goalie
- Rink
- Date
- Time
- Opponent
- Team
- League
- Result
- Notes

The Skater form should include the following
- Goals
- Assists
- Penalty Minutes
- Shots
- 
The Goalie form should include the following
- Goals Against
- Saves


## Add or Edit a Rink
This is more for convenience and also a way for me to group together stats.
- Name
- Location
- Notes
