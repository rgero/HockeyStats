## Hockey Stats
I've always been kind of a stats nerd, one of the areas I like to keep stats in is the amount of goals, assists and points I get in my recreational hockey games. The trends from these lets me know if I am playing well, if I need to step up to a higher level or if I need to take it easy of a bit.
This has always been true even back in high school when I'd track my stats for my goalie games.

### The purpose of this website
To enable a player to easily track their own progress/stats. When fully operational the user will be able to log games and get their stats based on those games.

- Position - This could be as simple as Skater/Goalie
